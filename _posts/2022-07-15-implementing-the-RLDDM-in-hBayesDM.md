# 1. Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been used to explain phenomena where feedback-based learning seem to play a role, including but not limited to Pavlovian conditioning, instrumental learning, and value-based decision-making. These models commonly posit a value assigned to a stimulus, an action or stimulus-action pair. The value-updating mechanism is a usually emphasized feature of these models.
