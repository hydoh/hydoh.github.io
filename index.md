# About Me

I'm a research assistant studying cognitive psychology in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, working with [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). I received my master's and bachelor's degrees in psychology from Seoul National University. 

My main area of interest is learning and decision-making. Specifically, I'm interested in biases in those cognitive processes. I try to address the following questions in my research: (1) what biases does human cognition have?, (2) what mechanisms give rise to the biases?, and (3) when are these biases adaptive and maladaptive? To investigate these topics, I mainly use behavioral experiments and computational modeling.
