I'm a Research Assistant studying cognitive psychology in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab (CCS Lab)](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, South Korea. My main area of interest is human decision-making and learning. Specifically, I try to understand cognitive biases in people's decision-making and learning to gain insights into the fundamental characteristics of human cognition. I mainly use behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and computer mouse tracking; I also have experience in neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
