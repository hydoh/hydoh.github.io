# About Me

I'm a research assistant studying cognitive psychology in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, working with [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). I received a master's and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Seoul National University. 

My main area of interest is learning and decision-making. Specifically, I study biases in learning and decision-making with behavioral experiments and computational modeling. In the long run, I aim to build a theoretical framework where a few fundamental characteristics of human cognition explain various biases in learning and decision-making.
