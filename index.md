# About Me

I'm a research assistant studying cognitive psychology in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, working with [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). I received a master's and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Seoul National University. 

My main area of interest is learning and decision-making. I'm especially interested in biases present in those cognitive processes. I try to answer questions like these: (1) what kind of biases does human cognition have? (2) what mechanisms give rise to the biases? and (3) when are these biases adaptive and maladaptive? To investigate these questions, I mainly use behavioral experiments and computational modeling.
