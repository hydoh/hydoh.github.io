# About Me

I'm a research assistant studying cognitive psychology in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab (CCS Lab)](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, working with [Dr. Woo-Young Ahn](https://ccs-lab.github.io/team/young-ahn/). I received a master's and a bachelor's degree in psychology from Seoul National University. 

My main area of interest is human decision-making and learning. Specifically, I study biases in decision-making and learning with behavioral experiments and computational modeling.
