I'm a research assistant in the [Computational Clinical Science Lab (CCS Lab)](https://ccs-lab.github.io/) at Seoul National University, South Korea. I study cognitive psychology and I'm interested in cognitive biases in human decision-making and learning. I believe investigating biases can help us reveal fundamental characteristics of human cognition. I use behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
