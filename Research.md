## Pavlovian-instrumental conflict and mouse-tracking
Pavlovian system provides preprogrammed responses to rewards and punishments, while instrumental system learns appropriate responses to get more rewards and avoid punishments. The two systems cooperate in many situations but they compete in others, hindering adaptive behavior. My colleagues and I investigate within-trial dynamics of the competition between Pavlovian and instrumental systems using mouse-tracking and extended drift-diffusion models.

## Pavlovian-instrumental conflict and working-memory load
Literature has shown that working memory load leads to greater reliance on computationally cheaper decision-making systems (e.g., in the competition between model-free and model-based systems). However, whether this is also true for the competition between Pavlovian and instrumental systems has not been examined yet. My colleagues and I tested if working memory load enhances Pavlovian system in Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. Working memory load did not strengthen Pavlovian system, but resulted in slower learning and more random choices.

## Stress and smoking
The ability to withstand psychological distress (i.e., distress tolerance) is an important predictor of smoking cessation relapses. My colleagues and I examine how smokers with high and low distress tolerance differ in smoking behaviors in response to daily stress during a five-week smoking cessation clinic.

## fNIRS-fMRI mapping
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) markers of individual difference are useful but expensive and difficult to collect in children and infants. My colleagues and I predicted fMRI markers of response inhibition and prediction error from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, which are cheaper and applicable to children.
