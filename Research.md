## Pavlovian-instrumental conflict and mouse-tracking
The Pavlovian system provides preprogrammed responses to rewards and punishments, while the instrumental system learns appropriate responses to get more rewards and avoid punishments. The two systems cooperate in many situations but they compete in others, hindering adaptive behavior. My colleagues and I investigate the within-trial dynamics of the competition between the Pavlovian and instrumental systems using mouse-tracking and extended drift-diffusion models.

## Pavlovian-instrumental conflict and working-memory load
Researchers have proposed that working memory load leads to greater reliance on computationally cheaper decision-making systems (e.g., the model-free system) rather than more expensive ones (e.g., the model-based system). However, this hypothesis has not been tested in decision-making involving Pavlovian-instrumental conflict, where the Pavlovian system is computationally less demanding than the instrumental system. My colleagues and I tested if working memory load enhances the Pavlovian system in Pavlovian-instrumental conflict. The results showed that working memory load did not strengthen the Pavlovian system but led to slower learning and more random choices.

## Stress and smoking
The ability to withstand psychological distress (i.e., distress tolerance) is an important predictor of smoking cessation relapses. My colleagues and I examine how smokers with high and low distress tolerance differ in smoking behaviors in response to daily stress during a five-week smoking cessation clinic.

## fNIRS-fMRI mapping
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) markers of individual differences are useful but expensive and difficult to collect in children and infants. My colleagues and I predicted fMRI markers of response inhibition and prediction error from functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, which are cheaper and applicable to children.
